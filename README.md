# WebGL
Investigation into WebGL as part of persuing my interest in 3D programming.

# Motivation
The motivation behind the project is to find any libraries or external tools to create terrains in 3D.
I discovered tutorials using three.js found here https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene
Full credit to the creators.
